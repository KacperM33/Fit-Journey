<br>The main screen displays a real-time map of user's current location, along with navigation buttons — all in one place for maximum convenience during workouts. 
<br>By pressing the **"WYŚRODKUJ"** button, the user can center the map view on their current position. Pressing **"START"** begins tracking the route - the app starts counting steps, calculating the distance traveled (in kilometers), and drawing a path line on the map. The **"STOP"** button stops counting, distance tracking, and path drawing.<br>
From this view, the user can also access three additional views:
- Top-left corner - **Note Icon**: Opens the **Music Controls** view
- Top-right corner - **"GALERIA"** button: Opens the **Photo Gallery** view
- Bottom-middle - **Camera Icon**: Opens the **Camera** view
